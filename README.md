Periphrastic's MUSH Code
========================

This is code in progress for one (possibly several) game-in-progress.  The version on GitHub should not be construed at any time as being the most recent production version, nor should it be assumed to be functional, and I will take no responsibility if you use it elsewhere without my knowledge and it doesn't work like you expect.

Currently, this package includes some global commands and functions.

In the near future, it will include:

* Room and exit parents.
* Temporary RP rooms.
* An updated version of Myrddin's bboard code, hopefully converted to SQL.
* A new SQL-based jobs system.
* Stats and chargen for one or more systems.
* Proper installer functionality so that files can always be uploaded directly.

This code is designed for TinyMUX 2.10.  It will probably NOT work with other MUSHlike codebases without significant modification.

The SQL that I am working with is inline, which does introduce some stability risks and may not be appropriate for gigantic games or older hardware.
